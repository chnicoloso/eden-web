## To Run the Application

1) Install Bottle.py by running `pip install bottle`.
2) Download these linked datasets (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Umab1d44y_yZxwlvNRU5KpLHygxfHHR_/view?usp=sharing) and add them to a folder called `/data` in the root directory of the repo.
3) Travel to `/server`
4) Run `python server.py`
5) After the server prints `Running on Localhost....`, it's ready.
6) Open a new tab in the terminal and from the root of the directory run `npm i` followed by `npm start`. The client should open in your browser automatically.
